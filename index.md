  Welcome! My name's Michelle and I'm interested in everything Data Science, from data exploration to building models and communicating results to other people who may not have a background in DS. Data is full of excitement and hidden gems, waiting to be uncovered. Feel free to explore around the site and peer into my personal interactions with the field.

  Have fun!
