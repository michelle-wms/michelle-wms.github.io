  Hello there! 
</p>

<p>
  My name's Michelle and I'm interested in everything Data Science & Analytics related, from data exploration to building models and communicating key data insights with people who may not have a background in analytics (best part of the job, imo). Data is always full of excitement and hidden gems, waiting to be uncovered.

  As a former Economist who self-taught coding and machine learning, the journey has been one filled with challenges. So I decided to fill some of the gaps by pursuing the <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/descriptions"> Masters of Data Science </a> at UBC. It has been amazing learning experience, through which I gained not only more technical programming skills and ML knowledge but also learned how to manage DS projects as a team player. Just like how Churchhill put it, "Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm". I hope to be able to demystify the term "data science" day by day, and inspire others who're interested in this field too.

  Thanks for visiting and hope you have fun peering into my personal interactions with the field.
