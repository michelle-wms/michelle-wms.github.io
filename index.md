  Hello there! 
</p>

<p>
  My name's Michelle and I'm interested in everything Data Science, from data exploration to building models and communicating with people who may not have a background in DS (best part of the job). Data is always full of excitement and hidden gems, waiting to be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
  As a former Economist who barely knew anything about coding or machine learning, the journey has been one filled with challenges. So I decided to fill some of the gaps by pursuing a <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/descriptions"> Masters in Data Science </a>. But just like how Churchhill put it, "Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm". I hope to be able to inspire more people who're interested to learn about the field and help demystify the term "data science" a little more.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for visiting and hope you have fun peering into my personal interactions with the field.
