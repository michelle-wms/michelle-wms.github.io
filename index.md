  Welcome! My name's Michelle and I'm interested in everything Data Science, from data exploration to building models and communicating results to people who may not have a background in DS. Data is always full of excitement and hidden gems, waiting to be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
  As a former Economist who barely knew anything about coding or machine learning, my journey on DS has been one filled with challenges. But just like how Churchhill put it, "Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm". I hope to be able to inspire more people who're interested to learn about the field and help demystify the term "data science" a little more.
</p>

  Thanks for visiting and hope you have fun peering into my personal interactions with the field.
