    description: A regression for predicting the quantiles instead of simply the average expected value. We use X-quantile regression to say "we expect values to fall below this X% of the time". For example, 90% quantile regression gives us the level at which 90% of values would be expected to fall within. Used in applications like giving customers an estimated time of arrival or delivery.
