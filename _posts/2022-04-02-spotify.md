Data visualization is part and parcel of a Data Scientist's toolbox. Besides using ready-built software like Tableau and PowerBI, there are other more powerful and highly customizable tools and one such example is Dash. Dash, an open-source library, was created in 2017 as part of the Python ecosystem by a company called Plotly. It has since evolved to also include compatibility with R and Julia. My teammates and I developed 2 Dash visualization apps on both Python and R using Bootstrap components.

This blog post will talk about my experience developing a Dash app and how we managed the product development process as a team.
Here is the python version of the Spotify Explorer Visualization Dash [app](https://spotify-explorer-pop.herokuapp.com/) we developed and published on Heroku. You can also find the github repo [here](https://github.com/michelle-wms/spotify-explorer-py).

#### 1. Prototyping
The process of developing a visualization app involves a mix of different skills and components. First and foremost, we needed to have a vision of what the app would look like. So we fleshed out different ideas of what graphs/plots to include and how the design would look like. I had alot of fun brainstorming the look of the app, and had this preliminary sketch of the app made:

#### 2. REPL with Jupyter Lab
Jupyter lab was used as my primary tool for REPL, data cleansing, wrangling and code testing of plots. We used Altair for our plots and had to ensure that they looked ok and were functioning as expected before piecing them altogether as one single Dash code. Since Jupyter Lab displays plots on the go, this was a convenient way to try out different plots and see how they look before transferring to Dash.

#### 3. Combining plots with widgets
Since this was an interactive dashboard, I added widgets for users to select the artists and genres they were interested to delve in. The dropdown widget allows you to both key in an Artist's name and scroll down, which is a handy way to quickly dive into the Artist you want to see. The widgets and plots were joined through "callbacks" through which the widget collects user input values and translates into outputs for the plot. Through this, data was filtered by dropdown inputs to display the correct plots.

#### 4. Bootstrap Components and Layouts
Besides ensuring plots' and widgets' functionalities, another very important aspect was the layout and design of the app. This involves frontend tools called Bootstrap components to help us with putting all the plots, widgets and graphics in their respective places. Bootstrapping is a popular web design tool written in HTML, CSS and Javascript that allows developers to quickly build responsive websites. Likewise, this allowed us to build a responsive Dash app. It was very challenging for a Data Scientist like myself with limited web design knowledge to figure out the syntax and mechanisms of bootstrap, but it proved to be powerful in making our app look close to what we envisioned in our sketch.  

#### 5. Tying things up and the nitty-gritties
To spruce things up, I added a collapsable introduction at the Navbar section at the top, allowing users to click on "About" and learn more about the dataset[^1] we used for the visualization. Since the app may take some time to load for some users, I also added a cool mini animated 'green cube' while the page is loading to entertain users while they wait. 

#### 6. Deployment to Heroku
Once we were satisfied with the app on our local servers, it was time to deploy to Heroku. Heroku is a platform that gives you 5 free apps to play around with, and is conveniently connected with Github to enable Continuous Integration and Deployment. So everytime someone pushes a new commit to the repo, Heroku automatically deploys a staging app and shows you whether it was successful or if there were errors. Finally, when everything runs smoothly, you can move the app to Production stage and show it to the world.

#### 7. Conclusions
As someone who has used a variety of visualization tools from Shiny (R) to PowerBI, I would say my experience with Dash was both enthralling and challenging. The biggest advantage of using Dash is to able to control every little detail for both frontend and backend. The interface with Bootstrap is also really neat, because it can look and feel like a proper website and be loaded on any device without the need to install any software. It does have quite a bit of learning curve because you're dealing with alot of stuff all at once and is developed on pure code (I've not seen so many brackets in my life). To see the app completed, nonetheless, is the most satisfying thing ever.
